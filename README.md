# Bank Transaction Categoriser
This is a python script that takes a CSV input of monthly banking transactions seperates them into "incomming" and "outgoing" transactions, then categorises each transaciton.  

## Description

This is the first script I wrote in Python to tests how the language works. It captures input from the user, then adds these variables to a pre-formatted prompt. Using the OpenAI API it sends this prompt to OpenAPI GPT3 and then prints the output. </br>
It's as simple as that!
